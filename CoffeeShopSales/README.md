<h1>Project Background</h1>

This project thoroughly analyzes the sales data of a coffee shop that operates at three different locations.
The aim of the project is to evaluate regional performance and identify market opportunities.

Insights are provided based on the following key metrics:
- Sales Trends Analysis
- Performance by Weekday 
- Product Level Performance

The Excel file containing the dashboard can be downloaded from here.

<h1>Data Structure & Initial Checks</h1>

The raw data is stored in excel file which contains 11 columns: transaction_id, transaction_date, transaction_time, transaction_qty, store_id, store_location, product_id, unit_price, product_category, product_type, product_detail. <br>
Using these columns, six other columns viz, revenue, month, month_name, weekday, weekday_name, and hour are created.

Before performing the analysis, the dataset was checked for the integrity of the values using filters and sorting.

The data is spread from January to June, 2023.

<h1>Observations</h1>

The total revenue of the company has increased steadily except in the month of February, when there was a slight decrease at all three locations. This may be due to the less number of days in February.
The highest jump in revenue was observed in the month of May.
